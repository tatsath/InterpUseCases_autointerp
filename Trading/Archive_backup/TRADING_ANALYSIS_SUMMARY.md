#### SAE Activation Mechanism

**Feature Extraction Process:**
1. **Input Processing**: Raw market data (OHLCV) → Hidden state extraction
2. **SAE Encoding**: Hidden states → Sparse feature activations via learned weights
3. **Activation Thresholding**: Features activate when input patterns match learned representations
4. **Pooling Strategy**: Multiple pooling methods (max, mean, composite) for robust signals

**Activation Patterns:**
- **Temporal**: Features activate based on time-series patterns in price/volume
- **Cross-Asset**: Features respond to correlations between BTC/USDT and DOGE/USDT
- **Regime-Dependent**: Different features activate in bull/bear/sideways markets
- **Event-Driven**: Specific features trigger on earnings, news, policy announcements

**Feature Interaction:**
- **Composite Features**: Combinations of individual SAE features for enhanced signals
- **Cross-Layer Integration**: Features from different layers interact for complex patterns
- **Technical Indicator Fusion**: SAE features combined with RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands

#### SAE Feature Contribution to Trading Performance

**Top Contributing Features (by F1 Score):**
1. **Revenue Metrics** (F1=0.90): Most reliable for fundamental analysis
2. **Stock Index Performance** (F1=0.84): Excellent market sentiment indicator
3. **Inflation Indicators** (F1=0.84): Strong macroeconomic signal
4. **Performance Updates** (F1=0.865): Real-time operational insights
5. **Currency Volatility** (F1=0.82): Cross-market correlation signals

**Feature Specialization Impact:**
- **High Specialization** (>7.0): Features 127, 384 - Provide unique, non-redundant signals
- **Medium Specialization** (4.0-7.0): Features 90, 3, 292, 273 - Balanced performance
- **Low Specialization** (<4.0): Features 343, 17, 389 - Supporting signals

**Activation Frequency Analysis:**
- **Frequent Activators**: Earnings Reports, Stock Index Performance (market events)
- **Moderate Activators**: Revenue Metrics, Economic Indicators (quarterly data)
- **Rare Activators**: Major Figures, Value Milestones (special events)

**Cross-Feature Synergies:**
- **Earnings + Revenue**: Combined fundamental analysis strength
- **Inflation + Central Bank**: Macroeconomic policy impact
- **Cryptocurrency + Currency Volatility**: Crypto market dynamics
