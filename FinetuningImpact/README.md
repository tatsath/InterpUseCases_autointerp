# Finetuning Impact Analysis - SAE Feature Changes on Financial Data

## 📊 **Analysis Overview**

This analysis compares Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features between a base Llama model and a finetuned Llama model on financial data to understand the impact of finetuning on feature learning.

## 🔬 **Methodology**

**Models & Dataset:**
- **Base Model**: `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf` | **Finetuned Model**: `cxllin/Llama2-7b-Finance`
- **Dataset**: `jyanimaulik/yahoo_finance_stockmarket_news` (50 samples, 256 tokens max)
- **Layers**: 4, 10, 16, 22, 28 (400 independent features each)

**Analysis Process:**
1. Compare SAE activations between base and finetuned models on financial dataset
2. Extract feature labels and F1 scores from Autointerp results
3. Rank features by activation improvements and detection accuracy

**Key Assumption:** Feature drift between base and finetuned models is not significant - the same feature indices represent comparable semantic concepts across both models.

## 🚀 **Conclusion**

The finetuning process has created **highly specialized financial features** across all layers of the model, with the most dramatic improvements occurring in the later layers (22, 28). This suggests that finetuning on financial data has created **domain-specific representations** that are much more activated on financial text compared to the base model.

The analysis demonstrates that **finetuning doesn't just improve overall performance, but creates specific, interpretable features** that are highly specialized for financial understanding, with the degree of specialization increasing with layer depth.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Layer Depth Matters**: Deeper layers show more dramatic improvements
- **Feature Specialization**: Clear transformation from general to financial-specific patterns
- **Performance Gains**: Consistent improvements in both activation and reliability metrics
- **Domain Adaptation**: Successful adaptation to financial text patterns across all layers
