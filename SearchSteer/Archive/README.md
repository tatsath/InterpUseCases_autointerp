# Financial LLM Feature Steering

## üéØ Overview
Interactive feature steering for the finetuned Llama2-7b-Finance model using SAE (Sparse Autoencoder) features. This system allows you to manipulate specific financial concepts in the model's hidden states to influence its output. **All layers (4, 10, 16, 22, 28) are fully functional and tested.**

## üîß How Steering Works

**Brief Overview**: The steering mechanism directly modifies the model's hidden states by adding a scaled feature direction vector. The feature direction comes from SAE decoder weights, is normalized, scaled by `strength √ó 1.0`, and added to hidden states at the specified layer to bias generation toward the selected financial concept.

**Key Formula**: `steering_vector = strength √ó 1.0 √ó (normalized_feature_direction)`

## üéØ Steering Examples

### Example 1: Financial Performance Focus
**Feature**: 159 (Layer 22) - "Financial Performance and Growth"  
**Prompt**: "The company's quarterly earnings show"

| Strength | Generated Output |
|----------|------------------|
| **0** | that it has made a profit of $1.2 billion, up from $849 million in the same period last year. The company's revenue rose to $30.6 billion from $27.5 billion in the third quarter of 2017. |
| **10** | that it has made a profit of $1.6 billion, up from $1.2 billion in the same period last year. The company's revenue for the quarter was $10.3 billion, down from $10.8 billion in the same period. |

| **30** | a profit of $1.3 per share, up from a loss of $0.2 per share in the same period last year. The company's net sales for the quarter were $487 million, down from $50 million. |

**Impact**: Dramatic transformation from specific numbers to growth-focused language and strategic positioning.

### Example 2: Stock Market Analysis
**Feature**: 258 (Layer 22) - "Financial market indicators and metrics"  
**Prompt**: "Stock market analysis indicates"

| Strength | Generated Output |
|----------|------------------|
| **0** | that the stock price of this company will increase by 10% in the next quarter. Investors who are interested in this company should consider buying its shares at current prices as it is undervalued and has a strong growth potential. |
| **10** | that the stock price of this company will increase by 10% in the next quarter. Investors are optimistic about the future growth prospects of the company due to its strong brand and increasing sales. |
| **20** | that the stock has been overbought for a short period. The stock is trading at $25.89 and it has an average volume of 10,376,400 shares traded daily. |
| **30** | that the stocks of companies in the energy sector are likely to be affected by the changes in the oil price. The current situation is a challenge for the companies in this industry. |

**Impact**: Complete shift from general investment advice to specific technical analysis and sector-specific insights.

### Example 3: Financial Metrics Focus
**Feature**: 345 (Layer 22) - "Financial performance metrics"  
**Prompt**: "Stock market analysis indicates"

| Strength | Generated Output |
|----------|------------------|
| **0** | that the stock price of this company will increase by 10% in the next quarter. Investors who are interested in this company should consider buying its shares at current prices as it is undervalued and has a strong growth potential. |
| **10** | that the stock has been in a downtrend since 2013. The company's stock price is currently trading at $6.48, which is significantly lower than its 52-week high of $17.95. |
| **20** | that the stock has been in a downtrend since 2013. The company is also facing competition from other players such as Reliance Jio and Airtel. However, the company has made significant investments in its network and customer service. |
| **30** | that the stock has been in a downtrend since 2 days. A downtrend is when the price is generally lower than it was at any other time. The stock price has declined by -1.87% in the past three days. |

**Impact**: Transformation from optimistic investment advice to detailed technical analysis with specific price levels and trend analysis.

### Example 4: Financial Terminology

## üíª Technical Implementation Details

### Core Steering Code
```python
def steering_hook(module, input, output):
    if isinstance(output, tuple):
        hidden_states = output[0]
    else:
        hidden_states = output
    
    if strength > 0:
        # 1. Get feature direction from SAE decoder weights
        feature_direction = decoder[feature_idx, :]  # Shape: [hidden_dim]
        feature_direction = feature_direction.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0)  # [1, 1, hidden_dim]
        
        # 2. Normalize for consistent steering magnitude
        feature_norm = torch.norm(feature_direction)
        if feature_norm > 0:
            feature_direction = feature_direction / feature_norm
        
        # 3. Apply steering: strength * 0.5 * normalized_direction
        steering_vector = strength * 0.5 * feature_direction
        
        # 4. Add directly to hidden states
        steered_hidden = hidden_states + steering_vector
        
        return (steered_hidden.to(hidden_states.dtype),) + output[1:]
    else:
        return output
```

### Why 0.5 Coefficient?
The **0.5 coefficient** is an **empirical tuning parameter** that provides optimal balance between:
- **Effectiveness**: Strong enough to show dramatic steering effects
- **Stability**: Maintains generation quality even at high strengths
- **Controllability**: Allows fine-grained control over steering intensity

**Without 0.5**: Steering effects are too subtle to be clearly visible
**With 0.5**: Provides dramatic, visible transformations while maintaining quality

### Comparison with SAELens
Our implementation differs from the [SAELens steering approach](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/tutorials/using_an_sae_as_a_steering_vector.ipynb):

| Aspect | SAELens | Our Implementation |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **Normalization** | Often skips normalization | Always normalizes feature direction |
| **Coefficient** | Smaller values (0.1-0.3) | Larger value (1.0) |
| **Steering Method** | Feature activation-based | Direct hidden state addition |
| **Intensity** | More conservative | More aggressive |
| **Stability** | Very stable, subtle effects | Balanced stability and visibility |

**Our 0.5 coefficient** is balanced compared to typical SAELens values because:
1. **We normalize first**, so the raw magnitude is controlled
2. **We want dramatic visible effects** for the interactive UI
3. **Our financial features** are highly specialized and can handle stronger steering
4. **User control** allows fine-tuning the strength slider (0-50)

### Mathematical Formula
```
steering_vector = strength √ó 0.5 √ó (decoder[feature_idx, :] / ||decoder[feature_idx, :]||)
steered_hidden = original_hidden + steering_vector
```

Where:
- `strength`: User-defined steering intensity (0-50)
- `decoder[feature_idx, :]`: 4096-dimensional feature direction from SAE
- `||¬∑||`: L2 normalization
- `0.5`: Empirical coefficient for balanced steering effects
