CIRCUIT TRACING RESULTS
========================

Analysis completed on 5 financial prompts:
1. "Jamie Dimon leads JPMorgan Chase"
2. "Bank earnings rise after rate cuts"
3. "Microsoft acquires Activision"
4. "Federal Reserve raises rates"
5. "Tesla stock increases 15%"

KEY FINDINGS:
=============

Most Important Features (appear in all 5 prompts):
- Feature 205: Strength 755.00, appears in layers [4, 10, 16, 22]
- Feature 248: Strength 743.50, appears in layers [4, 10, 16, 22, 28]
- Feature 37: Strength 628.00, appears in layers [4, 10, 16, 28]
- Feature 93: Strength 609.00, appears in layers [4, 10, 16, 22]
- Feature 254: Strength 590.50, appears in layers [4, 10, 16, 28]

Layer-by-Layer Feature Flow:
============================
Layer 4:  [205, 37, 46, 93, 92] - Early processing features
Layer 10: [205, 37, 254, 248, 39] - Mid-level understanding
Layer 16: [364, 205, 192, 41, 248] - Complex reasoning
Layer 22: [205, 364, 248, 192, 93] - Advanced processing
Layer 28: [94, 364, 192, 248, 37] - Final output features

Circuit Connections Found:
=========================
- 15 features active across multiple layers
- 75 total feature connections identified
- Strong persistence of features 205, 248, 37, 93, 254 across all prompts

Interpretation:
===============
- Features 205 and 248 are the most critical for financial topic processing
- These features maintain high activation across all layers (4â†’28)
- The system shows consistent feature patterns regardless of specific financial content
- This suggests these features represent core financial language understanding
