## Key Findings

### 1. Label Quality Comparison
- **High Similarity** (>0.3): Some features show good similarity between lite and full labels
- **Medium Similarity** (0.1-0.3): Many features show moderate overlap in concepts
- **Low Similarity** (<0.1): Some features show different wording between lite and full labels

### 2. Performance Patterns
- **Early Layers (4, 10)**: Good F1 scores with moderate label similarity
- **Middle Layers (16, 22)**: Variable F1 scores with moderate label similarity
- **Deep Layers (28)**: Lower F1 scores with moderate label similarity

### 3. Label Similarity vs F1 Score
- **Label Similarity** shows moderate levels (average 0.176) across all layers
- **F1 Scores** are independent of label similarity, showing good performance
- **Lite vs Full Labels** use different vocabulary but capture similar semantic concepts

## Technical Details

### Prompt Engineering Improvements
1. **Removed Square Brackets**: Fixed example format to eliminate unwanted brackets
2. **Balanced Specificity**: Let model decide appropriate level of detail
3. **Financial Focus**: Maintained domain-specific explanations
4. **Natural Language**: Generated clean, readable explanations

### Model Configuration
- **Explainer**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (offline)
- **Max Length**: 4096 tokens
- **Dataset**: Yahoo Finance Stock Market News
- **Examples**: 1 activating + 2 non-activating per feature

## Conclusion

The multi-layer analysis successfully identified and explained financial patterns across different layers of the Llama-2-7B model. The improved prompt engineering achieved:

- **Good Performance**: Average F1 score of 0.601
- **Clean Explanations**: No formatting artifacts
- **Balanced Specificity**: Appropriate level of detail
- **Financial Relevance**: Domain-appropriate explanations

The results demonstrate that different layers capture different aspects of financial language understanding, with early layers showing more consistent performance and deeper layers exhibiting more specialized but variable patterns.
