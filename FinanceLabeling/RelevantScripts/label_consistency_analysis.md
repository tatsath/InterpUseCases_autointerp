## Polymorphism Analysis Summary

### ðŸ”´ **High Polymorphism (80% of features)**
- **40 out of 50 features** show completely different semantic interpretations
- Labels change from financial/economic concepts to historical, technical, or linguistic concepts
- F1 scores often change significantly (both increases and decreases)

### ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Polymorphism (20% of features)**
- **10 out of 50 features** show some consistency but with notable differences
- Labels maintain similar semantic categories but with different specific interpretations
- F1 scores show moderate changes

### ðŸ”µ **Low Polymorphism (0% of features)**
- **No features** show consistent labels between runs

## Key Observations

### 1. **Domain Shift**
- **Previous run**: Strongly financial/economic focus
- **New run**: More diverse domains (historical, technical, linguistic, cultural)

### 2. **F1 Score Variability**
- **Average F1 change**: -0.15 (significant decrease)
- **Range of changes**: -0.82 to +0.36
- **Most features**: Show decreased F1 scores

### 3. **Label Quality Differences**
- **Previous run**: More specific, domain-focused labels
- **New run**: More generic, broader semantic categories

## Potential Causes of Polymorphism

### 1. **Context Sensitivity**
- Different datasets or data splits may influence label generation
- Model may be sensitive to the specific examples used for each feature

### 2. **Random Sampling Effects**
- Different activating/non-activating examples selected between runs
- FAISS sampling may produce different negative examples

### 3. **Model Instability**
- LLM explainer may produce different interpretations for the same feature
- Temperature or sampling parameters may affect consistency

### 4. **Feature Interaction**
- Analyzing all 400 features simultaneously may affect individual feature interpretations
- Competition between features for similar semantic space

## Recommendations

### 1. **Improve Consistency**
- Use fixed random seeds for reproducible sampling
- Implement label validation across multiple runs
- Consider ensemble approaches for more stable labels

### 2. **Better Evaluation**
- Track label consistency as a key metric
- Implement cross-validation for feature interpretations
- Use multiple explainer models for validation

### 3. **Feature Stability Analysis**
- Identify which features are most/least stable across runs
- Focus on consistently interpretable features for downstream tasks

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals **significant label polymorphism** in the AutoInterp system, with 80% of features showing completely different interpretations between runs. This suggests that:

1. **Feature interpretations are not stable** across different analysis runs
2. **Context and sampling significantly influence** label generation
3. **Care should be taken** when using these labels for downstream tasks
4. **Further research is needed** to improve consistency and reliability

This polymorphism represents a significant challenge for the practical application of AutoInterp results and highlights the need for more robust and consistent feature interpretation methods.
